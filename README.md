# Animadex
AI-Based Animal Recognition Through Image Analysis.
Kaggle database used- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antoreepjana/animals-detection-images-dataset
train dataset on about 80+ epochs for better accuracy.
The gradient descent will be converged at about 65 epochs.

ABSTRACT-

The recent exponential increase in image recognition abilities with deep learning has transformed the way we deal with the natural world.
 ANIMADEX is a system that is based on deep learning and is designed to recognize animal species from photographs and give the users relevant, real-time information. 
ANIMADEX applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for strong image classification and object detection based on a database of more than 50,000 labelled animal images of 80 different animals. The system is designed to be used as a mobile/web-based education tool, wildlife documentation support, and animal conservation assistance. 
The model will be trained on a large set of varying species to maximize accuracy and generalization in the wild. The project focuses on accessibility, scalability, and incorporation with AI technologies, placing clever wildlife identification into users' hands spanning from casual observers to researchers.
